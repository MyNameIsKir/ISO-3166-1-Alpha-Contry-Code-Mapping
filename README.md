# ISO-3166-1-Alpha-Contry-Code-Mapping
A simple library that maps between the Alpha-2 and Alpha-3 country codes

... It's pretty much two large dicts.

Four functions are included:

```
alpha2_to_alpha3(country_code)
  # Returns the corresponding alpha-3 country code
alpha3_countries()
  # Returns a list of all of the alpha-3 country codes
alpha3_to_alpha2(country_code)
  # Returns the corresponding alpha-2 country code
alpha2_countries()
  # Returns a list of all of the alpha-2 country codes
```
